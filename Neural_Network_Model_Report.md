# Neural Network Model Report

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to develop a deep learning model for Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit foundation, to predict the success of funding applicants. Using machine learning and neural networks, the goal is to create a binary classifier that can determine whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. This tool will assist the foundation in selecting applicants with the best chance of success in their ventures, thereby optimizing the use of their resources and maximizing the impact of their funding.

The analysis is based on a dataset containing information about more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup in the past. By leveraging various features about each organization, such as application type, industry affiliation, and use case for funding, the model seeks to effectively predict funding success.
